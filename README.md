## Overview

This project gathers and analyzes GitHub data for users based in Melbourne with over 100 followers, focusing on user profiles and repository attributes. The analysis explores trends in programming languages, popular licenses, and community engagement to provide insights for developers aiming to improve their visibility and influence.

## Data Collection

Using GitHub's API, we retrieved user profiles based in Melbourne with follower counts exceeding 100. For each user, we collected profile information and up to 500 of their most recently pushed repositories, capturing details such as programming languages, stargazers, watchers, and license types.
